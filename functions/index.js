Background:
Has a bit of a unique background for a software engineer. I was a math major at Carnegie Mellon, and got my Masters in math education from University of Columbia, I wanted to be a math teacher. I taught math at the middle school, high school, and college level for 5 years, and then decided to switch careers and became a tennis pro for five years. It was fun and physically challenging, but it didnt have the mental challenge I needed. I decided to take a bootcamp in NYC and switched careers again and became a software engineer. I then became an iOS engineer at a large startup called Earthcam for two years, helping to develop new features for their high definition cameras iOS app. After earthcam, i joined Meta in the middle of covid in 2020 remotely. I have been remote there for four years.

Professional Work:
- Earthcam: Oversaw iOS development of 4 live-production apps in Swift and Obj-C. Developed new APIs which allowed users to search cameras for live motion events using a responsive timeline scrubber. Decreased crash frequency from 4.8% to 0.7% of all users.

- Meta: Built and shipped Orion Glasses - the first AR Glasses prototype on the market - using JS, C++, Kotlin and React Native. Worked on the ARCalling team. Was “Polish” Captain, overseeing four different apps ensuring a high UI/UX bar and consistency between apps, working closely XFN with design team. Integrated wearable devices (Ray-Ban Meta, Smart Glasses, Smart Watch) with Meta iOS Family of Apps for peer-to-peer video calling using Obj-C, C++ and Kotlin. Led Instagram Smart Watch team. Experimented with new Instagram feed types connecting multiple APIs to allow a user to interact with posts using Obj-C. Developed new AR iOS app allowing users to scan a room, place AR Objects in room and capture videos using Swift, Obj-C and SwiftUI.

Side Projects:
My goal of becoming a software engineer was to build an app for kids who could not afford a premium SAT/ACT tutor to have access to premium tutoring content. I built Tutorius Math, a beautiful, sleek, stable iOS app that I released in 2023. It has over 10000 downloads, and is built primarily in Swift. I still maintain it today, it’s my baby.

A Technical Challenge i overcame:
An essential part of tutorius was to have short, bite sized easily consumable lectures. To make paragraphs easily consumable, I needed a way to have math symbols (LaTeX) occur in-line in a paragraph, which was not possible with any iOS libraries. I created an algorithm which created a drawing context, “drew” the math equation and took a picture, and added the picture attachment inline. Answered this unsolved question on stackoverflow: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/53978178/swift-display-latex-math-expressions-inline/57277287. Tutorius is available on the iOS app store.

What I do for fun:
